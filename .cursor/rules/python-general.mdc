- Prefer a modular asynchronous design with `asyncio`.

- Comments in code should be informative for explaining the flow of the code.

- Inline comments are only for small clarifications, avoid over-commenting.

- Never do redundant things using `subprocess` that can be done in Python code instead.

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle.

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yoursekf) Principle.
