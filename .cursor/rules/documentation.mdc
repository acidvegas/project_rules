## Writing Style

- Use a clear, direct, human tone. Avoid hyper-intelligent language that sounds AI generated.
- Never use emojis or the `—` character in any comments, code, or README files.
- For controversial projects *(malicious POCs, recon/intel scraping, spam/flood tools)*, include a disclaimer stating the tool is for testing purposes only, to be used with legal permission or on your own systems.

## Structure

Every `README.md` should follow this structure:

### Project Title & Description

Start with the project name as an H1 heading, followed by 1-3 concise paragraphs explaining what the project does.

### Table of Contents

Include a clickable table of contents with links to each major section.

### Requirements

List all dependencies with links:
- Software dependencies *(Python, Docker, etc)*
- PyPI packages *(with links to PyPI)*
- System packages or other tools

###### System Recommendations *(optional)*
- Recommended RAM
- Recommended disk space
- Any other system requirements

### Setup

Provide clear installation instructions:
- Package manager installation *(pip, npm, etc)*
- Manual installation with `git clone`
- Running setup scripts
- Environment variable configuration *(use tables for `.env` variables)*
- Any additional configuration steps

### Usage

Explain how to run the project:
- Basic usage examples
- CLI arguments *(use tables for clarity)*
- Configuration options
- Example commands

### Footer

Always end with the mirrors footer:
