## Function Conventions

- All functions should be in ABC order, seperated by 2 blank lines.
- Use `snake_case` for functions & use `PascalCase` for classes.


## Type Hints

- Use type hints on all function arguments & return *(`def example(name: str) -> bool:`)*
- **Never** use `-> None:` as a return hint.
- Do not use `from typing import ...`, it makes type hints & return hints looks hideous.


## Docstrings

All functions should have a docstring matching the formats below:

###### Functions with arguments:

```python
def example_function(name: str, age: int) -> bool:
	'''
	This is a short & simple to the point description of the function.
	
	:param name: This is a small description of the name argument
	:param age: This is a small description of the age argument
	'''
```

###### Functions without arguments:

```python
def simple_function():
	'''This is a short & simple to the point description of the function.```
```

- 1 blank line after a functions docstring line.
