## Memory-Safe Data Handling

When reading large files or fetching large amounts of data *(files, URLs, streams)*, process incrementally to avoid high memory usage:

- `yield` or async generators
- Read line by line or in chunks

Storing a massive amount of data in variables can yield high memory usage which may be avoidable in certain situations.

Apply only when applicable *(don't overcomplicate small data handling)*.
