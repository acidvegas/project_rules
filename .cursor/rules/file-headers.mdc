## Use proper shebangs:

| Language | Shebang                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Bash     | `#!/usr/bin/env bash`    |
| Python   | `#!/usr/bin/env python3` |


## Project name, credits, & file reference:

Any text-based file that supports comments must include the following header comments at the top:

```
# Project Name Here - Developed by acidvegas in Python (https://git.acid.vegas)
# project_dir_name/filename.ext
```

This is placed immediately after the shebang, if one exists.

Use language specific comment prefixes if applicable like how `C` programming uses `//` for comments.
