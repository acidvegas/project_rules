- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces.

- Always preffer using single quotes & not double quotes.

- Vertically align assignments, dicts, parameters, comments, etc for readability, example:

```python
self.chunk_max  = args.chunk_max * 1024 * 1024 # MB
self.chunk_size = args.chunk_size
self.es_index   = args.index
```

**Note:** Align columns with only 1 space after the longest item, avoiding excessive padding.

- Use `_` inside of large integers *(`250_000` instead of `250000`)* for readability.

- Inline comments should only have a single space before the `#`, unless vertically aligning.

- Always use 3 blank lines before `if __name__ == '__main__'.
