description: "Gitignore standards for excluding sensitive and generated files from version control"
alwaysApply: true

## Example of files to ignore:

- Sensitive settings or keys: `.env`
- Logs or temporary files: `logs/`
- Python cache: `__pycache__/`

Only include what is truly needed to be excluded from version control so we can keep secrets, logs, & auto-generated files out of Git.
